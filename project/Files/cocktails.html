    Over the Summer My best friend and I made cocktails for the two of us and my mother. 
    <br> We had a lot of fun creating these so I wanted to share our fun recipes and the best time to enjoy them.

          <b>Moscow Mule</b>
      </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the year I have always loved getting a Moscow Mule at the bars I go to.
        <br> Since the bars are closed this is definitely the best recipe to still enjoy a great Moscow Mule. 
        <br>The ginger taste that hits the back of your throat is incredibly refreshing. 
        <br>I also like to add more lime to the recipe below. 
        <br> I hope you enjoy making this!
        <br>

        <b>Ingredients</b>

        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>1 1/2 fluid ounced vodka</li>
          <li>1/2 fluid ounce lime juice</li>
          <li>ice cubes</li>
          <li>1/2 cup ginger beer</li> 
          <li>1 lime wedge for garnish</li>
     </ul>
  
      <b>Moscow Mule Instructions</b>
      <br>
      Step 1- Pour vodka and lime juice into a mug; add ice cubes and ginger beer. Stir to combine.
      <br>Step 2- Drop a lime wedge into the mug for garnish.
      <br> The ginger beer I love is the Triple Ginger Beer Brew from Trader Joe's its very good.
