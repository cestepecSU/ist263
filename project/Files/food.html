            <strong>Growing up my grandpa made the most amazing dishes.</strong>
            <br>Apa is from Negros in the Philippines. He grew up with many 4 sisters and one brother, making him one of six.
            <br> He always loved to cook and found a passion for it when joining the Coast Guard where he cooked for all his crewmates.
            <br> Now he cooks for my family, making amazing dishes that I’ve always wanted to recreate. 
            <br>Now living on my own I have been recreating his dishes with his help. 
            <br>The two recipes that I’ve included I was able to make on my own from my grandfather’s instructions. 
            <strong>I hope you enjoy making this food as much as I have.</strong>
